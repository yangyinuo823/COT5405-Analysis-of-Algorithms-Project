# COT5405-Analysis-of-Algorithms-Project

This simple project aims to compare the time complexity of different algorithms.\
Programming language: C++\
Project time：2020 Dec

### Problem Definition
Consider a city in Florida named Gridville that has a grid layout of m × n cells. Associated
with each cell (i, j) where i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n, Gridville architectural board assigns a
non-negative number p[i, j] indicating the largest possible number of floors allowed to build on
that block. A developer company named AlgoTowers is interested to find the largest possible
area (shaped square or rectangle) of blocks within city limits that allows a building of height
at least h

### Algorithm Design Tasks
*Alg1* Design a Θ(mn) time Dynamic Programming algorithm for computing a largest area
square block with all cells have the height permit value at least h.
Alg2 Design a Θ(m3n
3
) time Brute Force algorithm for computing a largest area rectangle
block with all cells have the height permit value at least h.
Alg3 Design a Θ(mn) time Dynamic Programming algorithm for computing a largest area
rectangle block with all cells have the height permit value at least h.
[Hint: For gradual progress and also partial credit you might consider working on a O(mn2
)-time
algorithm design first.]
