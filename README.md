### Problem Definition
Consider a city in Florida named Gridville that has a grid layout of m × n cells. Associated
with each cell (i, j) where i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n, Gridville architectural board assigns a
non-negative number p[i, j] indicating the largest possible number of floors allowed to build on
that block. A developer company named AlgoTowers is interested to find the largest possible
area (shaped square or rectangle) of blocks within city limits that allows a building of height
at least h
